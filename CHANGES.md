- Create `twisted` domain in `applications` topic.

- Test and coverage templates consider `mxmake-test-path`, `mxmake-source-path`
  and `mxmake-omit-path` in `settings` section of `mx.ini` to support inclusion
  of local package in `run-tests.sh` and `run-coverage.sh` scripts.

- Create `scss` domain in `js` topic.

- Create `gettext` domain in `i18n` topic.

- Create `lingua` domain in `i18n` topic.

- Conditional add local [requirement|constraints}.txt to LOCAL_PACKAGE_FILES.

- Generate one Makefile from snippets instead of including several files from
  subfolder.

- Semantic overhaul. "Domains" become "Topics" and "Makefile" becomes "Domain".

- Provide a set of default targets and a mechanism to extend it's dependency
  targets in domain make files.

- Rename `install` domain to `packages`.

- Rename `files` domain to `mxfiles`.

- Rename `venv` domain to `mxenv`.

- Extend hook to generate `sources` dependency targets for package reinstall
  (setup.py, setup.cfg, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, constraints.txt).

- Move `tests` and `coverage` domains to `qa` topic.

- Create `black`, `mypy`, `isort` and domains in `qa` topic.

- Add topic related metadata containing a topic description.

- Create `npm` domains in `js` topic.

- Create `jsdoc` domain, in `docs` topic.

- Create `rollup` domains in `js` topic.

- Create `karma` domain, in `js` topic.

- Create `zope` domain, in `applications` topic.

- Add `soft-depends` setting in domains to define conditional order of domain

- Make `sources` target an optional dependency.

- Extend makefile parser to provide multi line settings.

- Take local package into account to "dirty" if there (pyproject.toml,
  setup.[cfg|py]

- Check for the existence of pip in `*-clean` targets before uninstalling a
  package, to ensure the targets are working when running via the default
  `clean` target, where the entire virtual env gets removed.

- Remove redundant dependencies from `zope` domain.

- `sources` domain is now a soft dependency of `mxfiles` domain instead of the
  `packages` domain. This ensures source package checkout happens before mxmake
  generates files, because templates might gain information from source
  packages if present.
