# Getting started

## How to bootstrap a project with mxmake

### Essential Requirements

All installation methods require:
- [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) command-line tool
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install make`
  - macOS: `xcode-select --install`
  - Windows: [See installation guide](https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058#make)

### Choose Your Installation Method

mxmake supports two installation approaches:

#### Option 1: UV-only (Modern, Recommended)

**Requirements**: Only [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - **NO Python installation needed!**

UV automatically downloads Python when creating virtual environments, making it the simplest option for new projects.

**Install UV**:
```shell
# Official installer (Linux/macOS)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or via pip (if you already have Python)
pip install uv
```

**Bootstrap your project**:
```shell
mkdir myproject && cd myproject

# Run mxmake init (UV downloads Python automatically)
uvx mxmake init

# Answer prompts interactively or use --preseeds for automation
# Select topics and configure settings

# Run make install (UV creates venv with downloaded Python)
make install
```

**Key advantages**:
- No Python pre-installation required
- UV downloads the exact Python version you specify
- Faster package installation
- Ideal for CI/CD environments

```{note}
When using UV, set `PYTHON_PACKAGE_INSTALLER=uv` and `UV_PYTHON=3.14` (or your preferred version) in the Makefile settings section. UV will automatically download and use that Python version.
```

#### Option 2: Traditional pip-based

**Requirements**: Python 3.10+ with venv module
- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install python3 python3-venv`
- macOS: Python 3.10+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Windows: Python 3.10+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

**Install mxmake**:
```shell
mkdir myproject && cd myproject

# Option A: Global installation
pip install mxmake

# Option B: In a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install mxmake
```

**Bootstrap your project**:
```shell
mxmake init

# Answer prompts interactively
# This creates mx.ini and Makefile

make install
```

### After Initialization

Both methods create:
- `Makefile` - Generated by mxmake with your selected topics/domains
- `mx.ini` - Configuration for mxdev (if you selected that option)

To update an existing Makefile without interactive prompts, run `mxmake update`.

## How to change the settings

The `Makefile` consists of three sections:

1. Header with configured topics/domains
1. Settings (for customization)
1. Makefile logic (do not edit)

The header is not intended for editing, thus it does not cause any harm by adding or removing domains here.
It is considered during the execution of `mxmake init` respective `mxmake update`.
Added or removed topics are checked or unchecked accordingly on the next run.

The settings section is where customization is happening.
Domains can provide configurable settings.
Setting names must be unique among all domains.
Thus they are usually prefixed.

Each setting provides a description and an optional default value.

For details read the chapter [on topics and it's domains](topics-and-domains).

Do not add custom settings to settings section.
They will be lost on next `mxmake init` respective `mxmake update` run.

### Python Package Installer

mxmake supports two package installers:

**UV (Recommended)**: Modern, fast package installer that can automatically download Python.
- Set `PYTHON_PACKAGE_INSTALLER=uv` in the Makefile
- UV is auto-detected if installed globally, or installed locally in the venv
- **Specify `UV_PYTHON` explicitly** (e.g., `3.14`) to control which Python version UV downloads

**pip (Default)**: Traditional package installer, requires Python pre-installed.
- Works with any Python 3.10+ installation
- Uses the Python specified in `PRIMARY_PYTHON` setting

Example UV configuration:
```makefile
PYTHON_PACKAGE_INSTALLER?=uv
UV_PYTHON?=3.14  # UV downloads Python 3.14 automatically
```

Example pip configuration:
```makefile
PRIMARY_PYTHON?=python3.12
PYTHON_PACKAGE_INSTALLER?=pip  # Default
```

```{important}
When using UV, **always set `UV_PYTHON` explicitly**. While it currently defaults to `PRIMARY_PYTHON` for backward compatibility, relying on this default is not recommended and may change in future versions.
```

## How to use on the Windows operating system

mxmake works excellent on Windows!

On Windows it needs a Bash shell.
Fortunately the GIT VCS comes with the a fully function Bash, the git-bash.
Please follow  [GIT's official installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

Install [make as described here](https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058#make)

Further you need a [Python >=3.10 installation.](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

Dependent on the topics and domains you use, you may need to install additional software, but this is no different from Linux/OSX.

## Troubleshooting

### UV not found error

If you get an error that UV is not found, install it. See the [official UV installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for detailed instructions.

```shell
# Global installation (recommended)
pip install uv

# Or use the official installer
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, run `mxmake update` to regenerate the Makefile.

### Python version mismatch

If UV uses a different Python version than expected, explicitly set `UV_PYTHON` in your Makefile settings:

```makefile
UV_PYTHON?=3.14
```

Then run `make install` again.

### Tests not running

If `make test` fails with "command not found", ensure the test runner script was generated:

```shell
ls .mxmake/files/run-tests.sh
```

If missing, check that your `mx.ini` includes `mxmake-templates = run-tests` and run `make install` to regenerate files.

### Make command not found

On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install make`
On macOS: Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
On Windows: See [installation instructions](https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058#make)

### Settings not taking effect

Settings are only applied when you explicitly set them. If a setting has `?=`, it uses the default unless overridden.

Example: Change `PRIMARY_PYTHON?=python3.12` to `PRIMARY_PYTHON=python3.14` (remove the `?`) to force that value.

Note that environment variables always override Makefile settings. Check if a setting is defined in your shell environment:

```shell
echo $PRIMARY_PYTHON
```

After changing settings, run `make install` to apply them.

### Regenerating the Makefile

To add or remove domains without interactive prompts, use:

```shell
mxmake update
```

This preserves your current settings and updates the Makefile logic. To start fresh interactively, use `mxmake init`.

After upgrading mxmake to a newer version, run `mxmake update` to apply new features and improvements from the upgraded version.
